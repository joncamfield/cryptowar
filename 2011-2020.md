> "Comey also posed as a question “whether companies not subject currently to Calea should be **required to build lawful intercept capabilities** for law enforcement”, something he contended would not “expand” FBI authorities”. Calea is a 1994 surveillance law mandating that law enforcement and intelligence agencies have access to telecommunications data, which Comey described as archaic in the face of technological innovation. …  Comey, **frequently referring to “bad guys” using encryption**, argued access to the cloud is insufficient. “Uploading to the cloud doesn’t include all the stored data on the bad guy’s phone,” he said. “It’s the people who are most worried what’s on the device who will be most likely to avoid the cloud.”"

> "Under questioning Comey admitted that **even if the US did pass laws allowing law enforcement access to encrypted information, there were still plenty of tools produced outside of the US that would be untappable**, saying "we'd have a heck of a time trying to do that." Comey declined to say if selling borked crypto would put American companies at a disadvantage when trying to sell overseas. "

> "And as I mentioned, there are a lot of technological capabilities that are available right now that make it exceptionally difficult, both technically as well as legally, for intelligence and security services to have the insight they need to uncover it.  And I do think this is a time for particularly Europe, as well as here in the United States, for us to take a look and see whether or not there have been some inadvertent or intentional gaps that have been created in the ability of intelligence and security services to protect the people that they are asked to serve.  And in the past several years because of a number of unauthorized disclosures and a lot of handwringing over the government’s role in the effort to try to uncover these terrorists, there have been some policy and legal and other actions that are taken that make our ability collectively internationally to find these terrorists much more challenging.  And I do hope that this is going to be a wake-up call, particularly in areas of Europe where I think there has been a misrepresentation of what the intelligence security services are doing by some quarters that are designed to undercut those capabilities"

Oh you dear sweet summer child...

> "**If history repeats itself first as tragedy and then as farce, what does the FBI have in store next for its encryption war with Apple**? … Yet forgive us if this “conversation” now seems more like a Jim Comey monologue. The debate might start to be productive if the FBI Director would stop trying to use the courts as an ad hoc policy tool and promised not to bring any more cases like the one in Brooklyn. Meanwhile, the White House has taken the profile-in-courage stand of refusing to endorse or oppose any encryption bill that Congress may propose. If the Obama team won’t start adjusting to the technological realities of strong and legal encryption, they could at least exercise some adult supervision at Main Justice.

> ""**Warrant-proof encryption defeats the constitutional balance by elevating privacy above public safety**," Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in a speech at the US Naval Academy today (transcript). "Encrypted communications that cannot be intercepted and **locked devices that cannot be opened are law-free zones** that permit criminals and terrorists to operate without detection by police and without accountability by judges and juries." … "We know from experience that the largest companies have the resources to do what is necessary to promote cybersecurity while protecting public safety. A major hardware provider, for example, reportedly maintains private keys that it can use to sign software updates for each of its devices. That would present a huge potential security problem, if those keys were to leak. But they do not leak, because the company knows how to protect what is important. Companies can protect their ability to respond to lawful court orders with equal diligence." "

> "The Justice Department signaled Tuesday it intends to take a more aggressive posture in seeking access to encrypted information from technology companies, setting the stage for another round of clashes in the tug of war between privacy and public safety. … “Warrant-proof encryption is not just a law enforcement problem,” Mr. Rosenstein said at a conference at the U.S. Naval Academy. “The public bears the cost. When our investigations of violent criminal organizations come to a halt because we cannot access a phone, even with a court order, lives may be lost.
>" “Technology **companies almost certainly will not develop responsible encryption if left to their own devices**,” Mr. Rosenstein said. “Competition will fuel a mind-set that leads them to produce products that are more and more impregnable. That will give criminals and terrorists more opportunities to cause harm with impunity.””

> "**Warrant-proof encryption defeats the constitutional balance by elevating privacy above public safety**.  Encrypted communications that cannot be intercepted and locked devices that cannot be opened are **law-free zones** that permit criminals and terrorists to operate without detection by police and without accountability by judges and juries."
> "**When encryption is designed with no means of lawful access, it allows terrorists, drug dealers, child molesters, fraudsters, and other criminals to hide incriminating evidence**.  Mass-market products and services incorporating warrant-proof encryption are now the norm.  Many instant-messaging services employ default encryption designs that offer police no way to read them, even if an impartial judge issues a court order.  The makers of smart phones previously kept the ability to access some data on phones, when ordered by a court to do so.  Now they engineer away even that capability."
> "We refer to this problem as “Going Dark” –  the threat to public safety that occurs when service providers, device manufacturers, and application developers deprive law enforcement and national security investigators of crucial investigative tools. " […]
> ". Responsible encryption can involve effective, secure encryption that allows access only with judicial authorization.  Such encryption already exists.  Examples include the central management of security keys and operating system updates; the scanning of content, like your e-mails, for advertising purposes; the simulcast of messages to multiple destinations at once; and key recovery when a user forgets the password to decrypt a laptop."  […]
> "Responsible encryption can protect privacy and promote security without forfeiting access for legitimate law enforcement needs supported by judicial approval."

> "Some technology experts castigate colleagues who engage with law enforcement to address encryption and similar challenges," Rosenstein said. "Just because people are quick to criticize you does not mean that you are doing the wrong thing. Take it from me." […] There is nothing virtuous about refusing to help develop responsible encryption, or in shaming people who understand the dangers of creating any spaces—whether real-world or virtual—where people are free to victimize others without fear of getting caught or punished," Rosenstein said."

> "One of the most profoundly disruptive developments occurring in the cyber security arena today is the headlong rush by a set of parties to ubiquitously implement extreme End-to-End (e2e) encryption […] The generally understood objective by its zealous leaders is to cause everyone except the end parties of the communications services to "go dark""
> "Responsible commercial and intergovernmental industry technical venues have for decades adopted appropriate forms of Transport, Network, and Application Layer Security — rejecting extreme e2e encryption capabilities"
> "There is flatly no "right" to unfettered personal encrypted communication on publicly available infrastructures and services."

>"Senior officials debated whether to ask Congress to effectively outlaw end-to-end encryption, which scrambles data so that only its sender and recipient can read it, these people told POLITICO. … “The two paths were to either put out a statement or a general position on encryption, and \[say\] that they would continue to work on a solution, or to ask Congress for legislation,” said one of the people.

>"“I am here today to tell you that, as we use encryption to improve cybersecurity, we must ensure that we retain society’s ability to gain lawful access to data and communications when needed to respond to criminal activity,” Mr. Barr said. “While we should not hesitate to deploy encryption to protect ourselves from cybercriminals, this should not be done in a way that eviscerates society’s ability to defend itself against all these other types of criminals.”"

Honarary mention:
>"As the cybersecurity community dismissed Barr’s demands and outlined the myriad ways in which such backdoors could be exploited by criminals, the sad reality that most of the cybersecurity community has missed is that the encryption debate is already over – Facebook ended it earlier this year […] The company even noted that when it detects violations it will need to quietly stream a copy of the formerly encrypted content back to its central servers to analyze further, even if the user objects, acting as true wiretapping service."

Welcome to the rest of "Five Eyes":
> "After a two-day summit in London, senior ministers from the group comprising the United States and allies Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, said encryption should not come at the expense of the public’s safety. “We are concerned where companies deliberately design their systems in a way that precludes any form of access to content, even in cases of the most serious crimes,” the group said in a statement following the conference. “Tech companies should include mechanisms in the design of their encrypted products and services whereby governments, acting with appropriate legal authority, can obtain access to data in a readable and usable format.”

> "We are writing to request that Facebook does not proceed with its plan to implement end-to-end encryption across its messaging services without ensuring that there is no reduction to user safety […]  Signed by Barr, UK Home Secretary Priti Patel, acting US Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, and Australian Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton, the letter raises concerns that Facebook’s plan to build end-to-end encryption into its messaging apps will prevent law enforcement agencies from finding illegal activity conducted through Facebook, including child sexual exploitation, terrorism, and election meddling. […] "Security enhancements to the virtual world should not make us more vulnerable in the physical world," the letter reads. "Companies should not deliberately design their systems to preclude any form of access to content, even for preventing or investigating the most serious crimes."
