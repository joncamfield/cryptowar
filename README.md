# eternal cryptowar


Great quotes from the never-ending cryptowars - Additional historic quotes welcomed - please send quotes and links to [cryptowar@joncamfield.com](mailto:cryptowar@joncamfield.com)!

As we continuously debate "responsible encryption" here is a long scroll of pullquotes from the previous incarnations of CryptoWars. If you're concerned about this, <a href="https://supporters.eff.org/donate">donate to the EFF</a> -- they've always been there, fighting this insanity back. EFF also did a great quote-by-quote rundown of FBI directors [Louis J. Freeh and James B. Comey quotes](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/10/90s-and-now-fbi-and-its-inability-cope-encryption) from 1997 and 2014, respectively.
